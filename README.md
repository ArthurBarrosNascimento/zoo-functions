# Project Zoo Functions ü¶Å

<p>In this project, we applied all our knowledge about the fundamentals of programming using JavaScript. We used the famous HOFs, or Higher Order Functions. It was very interesting to work with them and see how they can be applied in different situations, understanding their particularities and applicability.

The HOFs were implemented on several arrays of objects that simulated data from a zoo, such as animals, employees, opening hours, and prices.

It was fun to develop this project because I was able to get a sense of how to manipulate data to get specific returns.</p>

<p>The project was carried out during the FullStack Programming course at Trybe, using knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
